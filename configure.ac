AC_INIT([Snrmga], [0.0.2], [tadeboro@gmail.com], [snrmga], [http://www.snrmga.org])
  # This line initializes autoconf and tells it that our package is named
  # "Snrmga", current version is "0.0.1", bugs can be reported to
  # "tadeboro@gmail.com" and that tarball should be named snrmga.tar.gz
  # "http://www.snrmga.org is the homepage of the project"

AC_PREREQ([2.64])
  # This line simply sets required version of autoconf.

AC_CONFIG_SRCDIR([src/snrmga.c])
  # This is safety check that can catch bad source directory being passed to
  # configure script via --srcdir switch.

AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIR([macros])
  # This line informs build system where additional macros can be found.

AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR([build-aux])
  # This line instructs build system to place auxiliary files in separate folder
  # (this keeps toplevel directory a bit cleaner).

AC_CONFIG_HEADERS([config.h])
  # This line instructs build system to create config.h header file instead of
  # passing all macros on command line.

AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE([1.11])
  # Initialize automake (we require 1.11 version here).

AM_SILENT_RULES([yes])
  # This line turns on silent rules.

AC_PROG_CC
  # This line searches for C compiler and sets CC variable.

AM_PROG_CC_C_O
  # This macro is needed in order to be able to build objects in subdirs (this
  # will be explained in greater detail later when we come to Makefile.am).

  # These lines enable support for multiple languages in application. They
  # initialize intltool and gettext (used to extract translatable strings) and
  # set some macros that we need in sources to init translations.
